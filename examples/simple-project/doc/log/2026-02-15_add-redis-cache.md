subject: Redis cache layer for API responses
short_story: Added Redis cache for expensive queries (user profiles, product listings). Cache-aside pattern with 5min TTL. Falls back to in-memory Map in dev when Redis is unavailable.

# L2 - Summary

## Problem

Product listing endpoint was taking 800ms due to complex joins. User profile endpoint was hitting DB on every request despite data changing rarely.

## Solution

- Cache-aside pattern: check cache → if miss, query DB → store in cache
- TTL: 5 minutes for listings, 10 minutes for profiles
- Cache invalidation on write (update/delete clears the relevant key)
- Fallback: `MemoryCache` class with same interface when `REDIS_URL` is not set

## Watch out

- Cache keys follow pattern `{entity}:{id}` (e.g. `product:123`, `user:456`)
- Invalidation is per-key, not per-prefix — bulk updates need manual flush
